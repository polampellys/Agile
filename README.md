## Agile-Focused Summary for the Autonomous Vehicle Project

* **Iterative Delivery**: Broke down functionality (e.g., sensor integration, path planning) into small, testable increments. Each sprint produced a working prototype or module, enabling early feedback and adjustment.

* **Scrum Practices**: Employed sprint planning to select high-priority user stories, daily stand-ups for quick sync, sprint reviews to demo increments, and retrospectives to identify improvements. Roles (e.g., Scrum Master, Product Owner) ensured clear accountability.

* **Backlog Management**: Maintained and refined a prioritized backlog of autonomous vehicle features. Adjusted priorities based on stakeholder feedback or technical findings, ensuring highest-value work came first.

* **Continuous Integration & Technical Excellence**: Integrated code frequently, ran automated builds/tests for C++ components, and conducted code reviews. This reduced integration issues, upheld code quality, and supported a sustainable pace.

* **Responsive to Change**: Welcomed requirement changes or new insights (e.g., altered sensor specs) by re-planning within sprints and updating the backlog. This flexibility kept the project aligned with evolving needs.

* **Feedback Loops**: Used sprint reviews and stakeholder demos to gather input early. Rapid feedback cycles allowed prompt course corrections in design or scope.

* **Velocity Tracking & Adaptation**: Monitored completed story points each sprint to refine estimates and adjust future sprint scope, maintaining consistent delivery without overcommitment.

* **Retrospective Improvements**: After each sprint, the team surfaced challenges (e.g., unclear acceptance criteria), applied root-cause fixes (e.g., better “definition of done”), and improved processes incrementally.

* **Collaboration & Communication**: Prioritized direct interactions (in-person or virtual) complemented by concise documentation and version-control discussions. This fostered transparency and swift resolution of blockers.

* **Key Takeaways**: Incremental prototypes enhanced feedback; adaptive planning managed technical uncertainties; continuous integration maintained code health; and regular retrospectives drove ongoing process refinement. These Agile practices enabled the team to navigate complexity effectively and deliver value steadily.
